## Background & Objectives

Sometimes, website need to show a photo album or a gallery of images. Let's play with that.

## Specs

Implement a 3x3 image grid with small images (300/200). When clicking on the small image,
it should open it in a bigger format (say 900x600).

You can use [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com) or 9 images of your choice (you need 2
versions for each image, a small one and a bigger one)

You should use [swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/).
